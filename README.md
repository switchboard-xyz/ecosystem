# Switchboard Ecosystem

Welcome to the Switchboard Ecosystem repository!

This repository is the data source for the Switchboard Ecosystem page, located at [switchboard.xyz/ecosystem](https://switchboard.xyz/ecosystem).

## About Switchboard

Switchboard is a multichain, permissionless oracle network connecting decentralized applications to real-world data across 10+ blockchains. Our cutting-edge technology brings any data source on-chain, offering customizable feeds, verifiable randomness, and secure storage. Secured by Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs), Switchboard ensures reliable and secure data delivery. With our all-in-one interface, developers can easily create, manage, and monitor data feeds.

## Contributing Guide

We welcome contributions from the community! If you know of a project using Switchboard or if you're a project developer yourself, please help us by adding or updating the relevant metadata.

A project is composed of two files: a JSON file, and an image. To add a new project to the ecosystem page, create both a new JSON file in the `projects` directory and add a new image in the `img` directory.

**!Important!**: If your Project already exists in this repo, refrain from creating a new JSON file in the projects directory! Rather, adapt your old metadata file in a new PR. Same goes for changed images or Logos for your Project.
